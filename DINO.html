        <font color="black"><li>1. Some dinosaurs were so large that their sneezes could create mini-tornadoes!</li></font>
        <br>
        <br>
         <font color="black"><li> The name "Brontosaurus" means "thunder lizard," but it turns out it never actually existed as a separate species. It was just a mix-up of fossils!

         </li></font>
         <br>
         <br>
          <font color="black"><li> There was a dinosaur called Microraptor that had feathers and was the size of a crow. It was like a tiny dinosaur version of a ninja bird! </li></font>
          <br>
          <br>
           <font color="black"><li>  Dinosaurs may have been colorfully adorned, but we can only guess their colors based on fossil evidence.</li></font>
           <br>
           <br>
            <font color="black"><li>  The Stegosaurus had a brain the size of a walnut, making it one of the smallest brains relative to body size among dinosaurs.</li></font>
            <br>
          
            <br>
             <font color="black"><li>   Some dinosaurs could lay up to hundreds of eggs at once, just like some modern-day reptiles.</li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li> T-Rex's arms were so short that it couldn't scratch its own nose!</li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li> The Triceratops had a massive frill on its head, but it probably didn't use it as a serving tray for snacks as some cartoons suggest.</li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li>The "velociraptors" in the Jurassic Park movies were much larger and not as smart as the real ones. They were about the size of a turkey in reality </li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li> Paleontologists believe that many dinosaurs made booming noises, roars, or cooing sounds, but we'll never know for sure how they sounded</li></font>
