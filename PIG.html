        <font color="black"><li>  Pigs are highly intelligent animals, often ranking as smart as dogs, and they have been trained to perform tricks and even play video games!

        </li></font>
        <br>
        <br>
         <font color="black"><li> Contrary to popular belief, pigs are actually very clean animals. They prefer to designate specific areas for eating, sleeping, and bathroom activities.

         </li></font>
         <br>
         <br>
          <font color="black"><li>Pigs have a strong sense of smell, which makes them excellent truffle hunters. In some parts of the world, they are used to find valuable truffles hidden beneath the ground.

          </li></font>
          <br>
          <br>
           <font color="black"><li>Did you know that a pig's squeal can reach up to 115 decibels? That's louder than a rock concert or a motorcycle!</li></font>
           <br>
           <br>
            <font color="black"><li>Pigs are social creatures and enjoy companionship. They like to communicate with each other through various grunts and oinks.

            </li></font>
            <br>
          
            <br>
             <font color="black"><li>Pigs have an incredible sense of taste, with around 15,000 taste buds! This makes them quite the food connoisseurs.

             </li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li>Pigs can't sweat like humans do, so they often cool themselves down by wallowing in mud, which also helps protect their skin from the sun and insects.

             </li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li> Piglets are known for their playfulness. They engage in games with each other, such as chasing and wrestling, which helps build their physical and social skills. </li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li> Pigs have a unique and diverse range of vocalizations, which allows them to express their emotions, whether they're happy, anxious, or seeking attention.

             </li></font>
             <br>
             <br>
             <font color="black"><li>Some pigs have been known to paint with brushes and create abstract artwork! Their paintings have even been auctioned off for charity.</li></font>
